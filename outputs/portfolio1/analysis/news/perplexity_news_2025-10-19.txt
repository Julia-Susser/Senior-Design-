Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company headquartered in Mountain View, California. Alphabet is the world's third-largest technology company by revenue, after Apple, and one of the world's most valuable companies. It was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015, and became the parent holding company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The establishment of Alphabet Inc. was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business "cleaner and more accountable" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced their resignation from their executive posts in December 2019, with the CEO role to be filled by Sundar Pichai, who is also the CEO of Google. Page and Brin remain employees, board members, and controlling shareholders of Alphabet Inc. Wikipedia... CEO

Frequently asked questions

Invesco QQQ is highly liquid because it is one of the most actively traded securities, with a history dating back to 1999. Like other passively managed ETFs, QQQ tracks an index. The Nasdaq-100 index includes many of the world’s leading technology stocks, as well as the companies at the forefront of many long-term innovative themes shaping today’s economy.

For more information on how innovation may help drive the performance of Invesco QQQ, click here.

*Source: Bloomberg L.P., QQQ is the 2nd most-traded ETF in the US based on average daily volume traded, as of June 30, 2025.*

Some investors use ETFs to gain exposure to broad ranges of companies rather than picking individual stocks, which reduces single-stock risk. For example, Invesco QQQ provides diversified exposure to many innovative companies, including leaders in software, hardware, e-commerce, social media, biotechnology, and other areas.

Typically, yes. ETFs are generally more tax efficient than comparable mutual funds because the “in-kind” creation and redemption feature of ETFs is designed to reduce cash transactions and capital gains distributions. As a result, investors tend to keep more of their returns.... *Invesco does not provide tax advice. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Investors should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situation.*

The decision to include ETFs in your portfolio will vary by your unique goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Investors can help diversify their portfolio with a handful of broad-based ETFs for various asset classes.

The market price of an ETF share is determined by the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying portfolio as well as supply and demand in the marketplace. Bid-ask spreads and premiums and discounts to NAV may also impact the price an investor pays for an ETF share.

For more details on how ETFs work, click here.

*Bid/ask spread is the amount by which the ask price exceeds the bid price for an asset in the market.*

ETFs can be actively or passively managed, and the choice depends on an investor’s financial objectives. Some financial professionals use a mix of active and passive ETFs in diversified client portfolios.

Invesco QQQ is passively managed and tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which offers exposure to many industry-leading companies in a single investment.

For more information on how Invesco QQQ can fit into your clients’ portfolios, click here.

ETFs are different from individual stocks in that an ETF’s liquidity is based on more than trading volume alone. A better predictor of an ETF’s liquidity may be the liquidity of the underlying holdings. For example, an ETF with relatively low trading volume that invests in highly liquid large-cap U.S. stocks will generally have high liquidity and low bid-ask spreads.... QQQ is one of the most heavily traded ETFs by volume.

For more information on liquidity and other considerations when trading ETFs, click here.

*Source: Bloomberg L.P., QQQ is the 2nd most-traded ETF in the US based on average daily volume traded, as of June 30, 2025.*

An ETF’s total cost of ownership depends on more than just its expense ratio. Investors also need to consider bid-ask spreads, trading commissions, and premiums and discounts, for example.

For more information on calculating costs of ETFs, click here.

*Bid/ask spread is the amount by which the ask price exceeds the bid price for an asset in the market.*

Invesco QQQ ETF has typically outperformed broad equity benchmarks like the S&P 500.

For more information on Invesco QQQ’s performance, click here.

*Standardized performance.* * Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Index returns do not represent Fund returns.*

Source: Bloomberg L.P., QQQ NAV 10-year performance reflected 18.71% growth versus 13.62% by the S&P 500, as of June 30, 2025.... ETFs are popular because they typically give investors access to broad market exposure with low fees, tax efficiency, and transparency. ETFs can be actively or passively managed and can be bought and sold like an individual stock.

*Invesco does not provide tax advice. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Investors should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situation.*

ETF is short for “exchange-traded fund.” ETFs are baskets of securities that can be bought or sold on exchanges similar to individual stocks. ETFs can provide exposure to broad areas of the market in a single, bundled investment. They are often passively managed and typically seek to track the performance of an index, such as the Nasdaq-100.

Yes. Invesco QQQ is a passively managed ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which contains some of the world’s most innovative companies.

For more information on the companies that make up the Nasdaq-100 Index, click here.

ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they both can provide exposure to broad areas of the market in a single investment. However, while mutual funds are priced once a day at the market close, ETFs can be bought and sold like individual stocks throughout the day.

Compared to mutual funds, ETFs tend to have better tax efficiency and more transparency, as well as lower fees on average.... *Investors should be aware of the material differences between mutual funds and ETFs. ETFs generally have lower expenses than actively managed mutual funds due to their different management styles. Most ETFs are passively managed and are structured to track an index, whereas many mutual funds are actively managed and thus have higher management fees. Unlike ETFs, actively managed mutual funds have the ability react to market changes and the potential to outperform a stated benchmark. Since ordinary brokerage commissions apply for each ETF buy and sell transaction, frequent trading activity may increase the cost of ETFs. ETFs can be traded throughout the day, whereas mutual funds are traded only once a day. While extreme market conditions could result in illiquidity for ETFs. Typically, they are still more liquid than most traditional mutual funds because they trade on exchanges. Investors should talk with their financial professional regarding their situation before investing.*

*Invesco does not provide tax advice. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Investors should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situation.*

You can typically invest in as little as a single share of QQQ or other ETFs through online brokers. Some brokers even allow investors to purchase a fraction of an ETF share.

Positive Sentiment: Q3 beat and upgraded NII forecast — BAC reported stronger profit and dealmaking, and raised guidance for net interest income, which supports near‑term EPS momentum and helped lift sentiment. Article Title Positive Sentiment: Multiple analyst upgrades and higher price targets — firms including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, TD Cowen, Evercore and others raised targets / ratings after Q3, boosting investor conviction. Article Title Neutral Sentiment: Debt redemptions announced — BAC will redeem €1.75B and... $2.5B of fixed/floating senior notes due in 2026, a financing/ liability‑management move that trims upcoming maturities but is largely routine. Article Title Article Title Neutral Sentiment: Preferred dividends scheduled — Board declared regular cash dividends on multiple preferred series (timing/amounts posted); routine for preferred holders and generally neutral for common equity. Article Title Neutral Sentiment: Unusual options and heavy volume noted — data shows elevated options activity and trading volume, which can amplify intraday moves but is not a directional fundamental driver by itself. Article Title Negative Sentiment: Lawsuits allege ties to Jeffrey Epstein — BAC (and other banks) were named in lawsuits alleging financial connections; this creates reputational and legal risk that investors will watch closely, though financial exposure is currently unclear. Article Title Bottom line for investors: positive earnings and multiple analyst upgrades are the primary drivers behind BAC’s rise today; monitor litigation headlines, NII trajectory and any capital actions (redemptions, buybacks/dividends) for catalysts that could sustain or reverse the move.Posted 1+ days agoAI Generated.
